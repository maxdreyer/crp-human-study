"""Code written by other people.

This code is (mostly) unmodified, but must be stored with the repository
because it isn't available via pip. It's usually research code.

Someone in the back asks: "Why not use git submodules?"
I answer: because they are a huge pain. Also, we often need to make
small adjustments to the imports so that the code runs.
